## Testing (PR checks)

Static analysis and browser smoke tests run on every pull request via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/site-tests.yml`).

```bash
npm ci
npm test                 # static + e2e
npm run test:static      # fast HTML/link/form checks (Vitest)
npm run test:e2e         # browser smoke tests (Playwright; run `npx playwright install chromium` once locally)
```

**Static checks** validate page structure, SEO meta tags, internal links, nav consistency, Netlify form wiring, footer contact info, and design-token presence in CSS.

**E2E checks** load every page in Chromium, verify navigation, forms, and key homepage content.

## Local preview

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory site
# → http://localhost:8080
```

## Deploy (GitHub + Netlify)

1. Create a repo at github.com/new (e.g. `successmetrics-website`)
2. Push this folder (see commands below)
3. At app.netlify.com: **Add new site → Import an existing project → GitHub** → pick the repo → Deploy (no build settings needed; `netlify.toml` sets `publish = "site"`)
4. Every future `git push` auto-deploys in ~30 seconds

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/successmetrics-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Custom domain

Netlify → Site settings → Domain management → Add `www.successmetrics.io`, then update the DNS records at your registrar as Netlify instructs. SSL is automatic.

## Forms (Netlify Forms — already wired up)

Both forms (`job-application` in `site/careers.html`, `contact` in `site/contact.html`) use [Netlify Forms](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/). After the first deploy:

1. Netlify dashboard → your site → **Forms** — submissions (including resume uploads, 8 MB max) appear here
2. **Site settings → Forms → Form notifications** — add email notifications (e.g. careers@successmetrics.io and support@successmetrics.io)

Spam protection via honeypot field is included. Note: forms only work on the deployed Netlify site, not when opening files locally.

## Editing with AI

This site is designed to be edited conversationally (Claude, Cursor, etc.):
- All design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) are CSS variables at the top of `site/assets/css/styles.css`
- Each page is self-contained; nav/footer are repeated per page — ask the AI to "update the nav on all pages" when changing menus
- New blog post = copy an existing file in `site/content/`, replace content, add a card in `site/resources.html`
